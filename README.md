# adaptableblotter

Repository for the multiple Adaptable packages developed by Adaptable Tools, including:

- 'Core' HTML5 version (adaptableblotter)
- React wrapper (adaptableblotter-react-aggrid)
- Angular wrapper (adaptableblotter-ng-aggrid)

The Adaptable is a powerful HTML5 DataGrid add-on that integrates with the leading datagrid components and provides all the additional, rich functionality that financial and other advanced users expect from their grids and blotters.

It offers - out of the box - incredibly powerful searching, filtering, sorting, styling and editing functionality. It also provides unparalleled validation and audit functions, vital in the current regulatory and compliance environment. Try it out for yourself at https://demo.adaptableblotter.com.

The Adaptable supports a number of underlying vendor grid components, and new vendor grids are being added all the time.  Please contact us if you would like us to implement your favourite HTML5 grid control.

The Adaptable is fully data agnostic and can work with any data set you provide it with. It is suitable for all data, all asset classes, all grid types, all locations and all use cases.

## Licences

The Adaptable is a commercial product and requires a purchased licence for use.

The Adaptable licence covers both Adaptable.NET and Adaptable.JS versions, and offers regular updates and full support.

If you wish to evaluate the Adaptable before purchase, please contact us requesting a Trial Licence.

Licences are sold to end-users typically in 'bands' so the price per user falls as volumne increases. There is also a Universal option which gives unlimited usage to unlimited users.

Note: The Adaptable licence does not include the licence for the underlying grid - if you use a vendor grid that requires a commerical licence, you must purchase that separately.

Please contact the Adaptable Tools Sales Team at sales@adaptabletools.com for more information.
