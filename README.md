# adaptableblotter
Repository for the multiple Adaptable Blotter packages developed by Adaptable Tools, including HTML5 version (AdaptableBlotter.JS), React version (adaptableblotter-react), and (soon to come) Angular version (adaptableblotter-angular).

AdaptableBlotter.JS is a powerful DataGrid add-on that integrates with the leading datagrid components and provides all the additional, rich functionality that financial and other advanced users expect from their grids and blotters.

It offers - out of the box - incredibly powerful searching, filtering, sorting, styling and editing functionality.  It also provides unparalleled validation and audit functions, vital in the current regulatory and compliance environment.  Try it out for yourself at https://demo.adaptableblotter.com.

Grid components supported included Telerik's Kendo Grid, the ag-Grid, OpenFin's Hypergrid and the Adaptable Grid by Adaptable Tools. And more grid components are being added all the time so contact us if you would like us to implement your favourite HTML5 grid control.

AdaptableBlotter.JS is fully data agnostic and can work with any data set you provide it with.  It is suitable for all data, all asset classes, all grid types, all locations and all use cases.
