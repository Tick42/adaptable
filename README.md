## Licences

The Adaptable Blotter is a commercial product and requires a purchased licence for use.

The Adaptable Blotter licence covers both AdaptableBlotter.NET and AdaptableBlotter.JS versions, and offers regular updates and full support.

If you wish to evaluate the Adaptable Blotter before purchase, please contact us requesting a Trial Licence.

Licences are sold to end-users typically in 'bands' so the price per user falls as volumne increases. There is also a Universal option which gives unlimited usage to unlimited users.

Note: The Adaptable Blotter licence does not include the licence for the underlying grid - if you use a vendor grid that requires a commerical licence, you must purchase that separately.
