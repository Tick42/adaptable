Repository for AdapTable - the market-leading Data Management toolkit developed by Adaptable Tools

AdapTable (previously known as the Adaptable Blotter) is a powerful HTML5 DataGrid add-on that integrates with the leading datagrid components and provides all the additional, rich functionality that financial and other advanced users expect from their DataGrids and Data Tables.

It offers - out of the box - incredibly powerful searching, filtering, sorting, styling and editing functionality. It also provides unparalleled validation and audit functions, vital in the current regulatory and compliance environment. 

AdapTable supports a number of underlying vendor grid components, and new vendor grids are being added all the time.  Please contact us if you would like us to implement your favourite HTML5 grid control.

AdapTable is fully data agnostic and can work with any data set you provide it with. It is suitable for all data, all asset classes, all grid types, all locations and all use cases.

## Plug-Ins

In order to reduce download size and ensure that you only use the components and functionality you require, AdapTable now offers Plug-Ings.

The 'Core' package contains everything you need to get started.  

However Plug-Ins offer additional sector-specific, or advanced functionality.  These include:

- Finance Plug-In (for Financial Services users)
- Charting Plug-In (a wide range of chart types that leverage Infragistics React charts)


## Framework Wrappers

AdapTable works out of the box.

However for those users who use a particular framework, AdapTable offers Framework Wrappers.  These are currently:

- React wrapper (adaptable-react-aggrid)
- Angular wrapper (adaptable-ng-aggrid)

## Licences

AdapTable is a commercial product and requires a purchased licence for use.

The AdapTable licence covers both Adaptable.NET (WinForms / WPF) and Adaptable.JS (HTML5) versions, and offers regular updates and full support.

If you wish to evaluate AdapTable before purchase, please contact us requesting a Trial Licence.

Licences are sold to end-users typically in 'bands' so the price per user falls as volumne increases. There is also a Universal option which gives unlimited usage to unlimited users.

Note: AdapTable licences do not include the licence for the underlying grid - if you use a vendor grid that requires a commerical licence, you must purchase that separately.
