## Licences

The Adaptable Blotter is a commercial product and requires a purchased licence for use.
There are 3 licence types available (all sold on an annual basis):

- _Community_ - free for charities, students in full time education and open-source projects. Offers full range of functionality but state cannot be saved.
- _Standard_ - offers full functionality of the Adaptable Blotter but state for Enteprise modules like Charting cannot be saved.
- _Enterprise_ - provides full access to all functionality and modules in the Adaptable Blotter and all state is saved.

The Adaptable Blotter licence covers both AdaptableBlotter.NET and AdaptableBlotter.JS versions, and offers regular updates and full support.

It is free to use the Evaluation for an evaulation (a Community licence will be given).

Licences are sold to end-users (they are free for developers), typically in 'bands' so the price per user falls as volumne increases. There is also a Universal option which gives unlimited usage to unlimited users.

Note: The Adaptable Blotter licence does not include the licence for the underlying grid - if you use a vendor grid that requires a commerical licence, you must purchase that separately.
