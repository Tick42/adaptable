# Adaptable Blotter Angular ag-Grid

Repository for the Adaptable Blotter Angular ag-Grid Wrapper.

This allows you to install, instantiate and reference the Adaptable Blotter on top of ag-Grid in an "Angular-friendly" manner.

## What's Included
There are 2 angular components available for use.

1.  *AdaptableBlotterComponent* - this is a general Component that wraps the Adaptable Blotter and requires you to create your own ag-Grid component to sit alongside it.

2.  *AdaptableblotterAgGridComponent* - this wraps both the Adaptable Blotter and Ag Grid angular components into a single component which you can manage as one object.

## Installation
To install Adaptable Blotter Angular ag-Grid via npm, you need to follow these 3 steps:

1.  Install the Adapbleblotter

```javascript
npm install --save adaptableblotter

## Licences
The Adaptable Blotter is a commercial product and requires a purchased licence for use.
There are 3 licence types available (all sold on an annual basis):

* *Community* - free for charities, students in full time education and open-source projects.  
* *End User* - licences are sold in bands depending on the number of end users
* *Universal* - unlimited users and usage.

The Adaptable Blotter licence covers both AdaptableBlotter.NET and AdaptableBlotter.JS versions, and offers regular updates and full support.

Note: The Adaptable Blotter licence does not include the licence for the underlying grid - if you use a vendor grid that requires a commerical licence, you must purchase that separately.
