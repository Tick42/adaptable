## Licences
The Adaptable Blotter is a commercial product and requires a purchased licence for use.
There are 3 licence types available (all sold on an annual basis):

* *Community* - free for charities, students in full time education and open-source projects.  
* *End User* - licences are sold in bands depending on the number of end users
* *Universal* - unlimited users and usage.

The Adaptable Blotter licence covers both AdaptableBlotter.NET and AdaptableBlotter.JS versions, and offers regular updates and full support.

Note: The Adaptable Blotter licence does not include the licence for the underlying grid - if you use a vendor grid that requires a commerical licence, you must purchase that separately.
