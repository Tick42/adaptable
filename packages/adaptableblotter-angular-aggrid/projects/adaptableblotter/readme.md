The Adaptable Blotter licence covers both AdaptableBlotter.NET and AdaptableBlotter.JS versions, and offers regular updates and full support.

It is free to use the Evaluation for an evaulation (a Community licence will be given).

Licences are sold to end-users (they are free for developers), typically in 'bands' so the price per user falls as volumne increases. There is also a Universal option which gives unlimited usage to unlimited users as well as a Team option for small teams.

Note: The Adaptable Blotter licence does not include the licence for the underlying grid - if you use a vendor grid that requires a commerical licence, you must purchase that separately.
