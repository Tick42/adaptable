# AdapTable Column Values FAQ

 By default AdapTable will populate the listbox with all the distinct values for that column currently in the grid.

  However you can, alternatively, specify what the permitted values are for any column and then only those values will be displayed.  (See User Interface Config).

  A third alternative is to use the getColumnValues property of Query Options which provides a callback function to be called by AdapTable whenever column values are required.  The implementation for this callback is provided by  each user and allows them to react dynamically each time a filter is opened or a Query is built.

  You  can find out more about the 3 different options available at Column Values.

## Help

Developers can learn how to access AdapTable programmatically at [AdapTable Developer Documentation](https://api.adaptabletools.com) 

The other source for Help is our collection of 'Read Me' Docs ([full list here](https://github.com/AdaptableTools/adaptable/blob/master/packages/adaptable/readme/readme-list.md)).

> Previously the main source of AdapTable Help was our [Zendesk Pages](https://adaptabletools.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) but these have been replaced by these 'Read Me' docs and the Developer Documentation that is automatically produced and therefore always up to date.
