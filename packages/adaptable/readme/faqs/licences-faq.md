# AdapTable Licences FAQ

**Do we need a licence to do a long-term POC?**

Yes. Its generally free to do an evaluation of AdapTable, using a Trial Licence, and that gives you full access to all the functions.

If you want to do a longer-term POC then you will need to negotiate for a commercial Trial Licence. The cost of this is fully redeemable against a Licence.

**How much do licences cost?**

It depends on how many users there are in your company. We have a sliding scale of cost, so the more users you have the lower the cost per user.

We also offer Universal licence which gives you unlimited usage for unlimited users.

**We are a software company so we don't know how many end users we will have. Is there a model that works for us?.**

Yes, we offer a Universal licence for software houses and similar companies who are unable to provide us with a precise number of end users. In this scenario, we set a fixed annual price that allows for unlimited usage (and unlimited users).

**How long does a licence last?**

One year from when it is signed.

**Does that include updates?**

Yes, we guarantee a minimum of 4 quarterly updates a year.

**Do you keep track on the number of end user licenses being used?**

No we don't. We rely on the honesty and good faith of our customers to tell us how many users they have. We are pleased that we have a great relationship with many large organisations who provide us with this information readily.

**Does that include Support? And if so, how much?**

We provide long daytime support and guarantee to answer support questions within a maximum of 12 hours. You can either use our Zendesk support to submit a request, or contact Support directly at support@adaptabletools.com

**What happens if an underlying grid releases a new version? Does the licence cover that?**

We guarantee to support any major release of an underlying vendor grid within 30 days of its release. We try to ensure backward compatibility but obviously if there are breaking changes then we will support only the newest version.


## Help

Developers can learn how to access AdapTable programmatically at [AdapTable Developer Documentation](https://api.adaptabletools.com) 

The other source for Help is our collection of 'Read Me' Docs ([full list here](https://github.com/AdaptableTools/adaptable/blob/master/packages/adaptable/readme/readme-list.md)).

> Previously the main source of AdapTable Help was our [Zendesk Pages](https://adaptabletools.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007083017-Help-) but these have been replaced by these 'Read Me' docs and the Developer Documentation that is automatically produced and therefore always up to date.
