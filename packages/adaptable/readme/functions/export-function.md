## FAQ

Where can we export data to?

Currently you can export reports to the following destinations (though more are being added all the time):

CSV

Clipboard

JSON

Excel - if using OpenFin

iPushPull - an iPushPull account is required

Can we have Live Updates if not using either OpenFin or iPushPull?

No.  You will need to be either running in the OpenFin container or have an iPushPull account to benefit from Live Updates.

Do you include column names in the exported data?

Yes, column names are always included in the report.

Is there an option when just copying to the clipboard to exclude column names?

Not at present but this feature will be added in future releases.

Is there a limit on the number of reports that I can create?

No, reports like all other Adaptable Objects are unlimited.

Can I export the underlying raw value in the column and not the displayed / formatted one?

Yes, the exportColumnRawValue property in Export Options allows you to choose for each report / column combination whether to export the Display Value (the default) or the Raw Value.
