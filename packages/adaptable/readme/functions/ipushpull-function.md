## FAQ

Do we need to be an existing ipushpull User to use this?

Yes. We provide this functionality only for existing ipushpull users.

You will need to provide your username and password in the Login Control.

How do I provide my ipushpull Credentials?

As part of ipushpull State. You must inject the ipushpull instance into AdapTable. (This allows us to reduce the size of the bundle so that we only ship core dependencies).

Note
You should provide the config that we show you, as we will later inject the ipushpull 'key' and 'secret' properties.

Can I create a new ipushpull page in AdapTable?

Yes, you can. This functionality was added in Version 6 (January, 2020).
