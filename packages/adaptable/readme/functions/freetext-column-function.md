# FreeText Column (AdaptableFunction)

The FreeText Column([AdaptableFunctionName](https://api.adaptabletools.com/modules/_src_predefinedconfig_common_types_.html#adaptablefunctionname): `FreeTextColumn`) Function provides a way to provide an entirely new Data Set to AdapTable based on user selection.

Free Text Columns are special columns which you create to save comments and other text that you want to save.

Warning
Any text stored in a Free Text Column is saved as part of the user state and not with the actual data source.

These columns are particularly useful if you wish to create a 'Comments' column or something pertinent only to you.
