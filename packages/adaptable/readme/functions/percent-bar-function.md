# Percent Bar (AdaptableFunction)

The Percent Bar([AdaptableFunctionName](https://api.adaptabletools.com/modules/_src_predefinedconfig_common_types_.html#adaptablefunctionname): `PercentBar`) Function enables numeric columns to be viewed as a 'bar' where each cell is filled as a % of its value against the maximum value for the column.

This function allows you to render numeric columns using coloured horizontal bars.

The width of the bar is proportional to the value in the column.

Tip
You are able to specify whether to see, additionally, the actual cell value (which you can also choose to see as a tooltip).

You can set the minimum and maximum values which AdapTable uses to work out the width of the bar (the defaults are the currently minimum and maximum values in the column respectively). Alternatively, you can set these to be other columns rather than 'hard-coded' values (e.g. you can set the percent bar in Column 'A' so that it displays the width as the percentage of the value in Column 'A' compared to that in Column 'B'.
