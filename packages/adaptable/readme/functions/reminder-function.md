# Reminder (AdaptableFunction)

The Reminder([AdaptableFunctionName](https://api.adaptabletools.com/modules/_src_predefinedconfig_common_types_.html#adaptablefunctionname): `Reminder`) Function faciliates the creation of scheduled reminders so that users don't forget to do important grid actions

A Reminder is an Alert that runs according to a Schedule. So, unlike Alerts, it is not trigged by a data (or other) changes, but according to a date schedule set by you.

Tip
The Schedule can be either a one-off date, or it can be a Recurring event (e.g. every Monday at 8am, or every day at 17:00).

Note
AdapTable publishes an event each time an alert is fired and this will include if it was triggered by a Reminder.
