## FAQ

Can I create my own theme if I don't like either of the presets?

Yes, you can create your own theme based on your own colour scheme. Everything is based on CSS Variables.

If I change the theme, will that get saved?

A. Yes, the last selected theme is saved in the user's settings and selected the next time AdapTable is loaded.

Which System Themes do you ship?

We ship with 2 themes: Light Theme and Dark Theme

Why do you only provide 2 themes - there used to be more?

We used to offer 15 themes but we found that, in practice, users were only using the white or dark theme or were creating their own. So to reduce the download footprint we now only offer 2 themes but make it easy for you to add as many other as you want.

Can I make my theme update the Underlying Grid like the System Themes do?

You will need to do that yourself .

How do I upload my own theme?

You can do that through configuration. The Themes section has a 'UserThemes' collection, each of which specifies a Name and Description. These themes will appear in the themes dropdown like the system themes and get resolved when they are selected. The Description is the value that will appear in the dropdown and the Name is the name of the css file that you have to provide.
