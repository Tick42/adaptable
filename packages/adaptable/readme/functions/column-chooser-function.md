# Column Chooser (AdaptableFunction)

The Column Chooser ([AdaptableFunctionName](https://api.adaptabletools.com/modules/_src_predefinedconfig_common_types_.html#adaptablefunctionname): `ColumnChooser`) Function provides a Popup that enables you easily to order columns and also show and hide them.
Use the Column Chooser to select which columns are visible in your grid and in which order.

If a Layout is being used, then any changes made to the column order will become part of the Layout (and will 'AutoSave' if that option has been set to true).

> Column Chooser is designed for managing **column visiblity**.  To control **row visibility**, use one of the many Search Functions instead.
