# Action Column (AdaptableFunction)

The Action Column ([AdaptableFunctionName](https://api.adaptabletools.com/modules/_src_predefinedconfig_common_types_.html#adaptablefunctionname): `ActionColumn`) Function provides an at-a-glance overview of a given column in AdapTable.  

An Action Column is used when you want to add a button to a row.

Create an Action Column n the ActionColumn property of Predefined Config, which will allow you to render the button how you wish and also provide the function that will be applied when the button is clicked.
