## FAQ


How many Charts Type are there?

Currently 2 (Category and Doughnut) but more to come in due course.

The Charts package is very large - can I avoid using and downloading it?

Yes, Charting as of Version 6 (January 2020) is provided as an Adaptable Plugin; so if you don't want to use Charting then simply don't request the Charting Plugin.
