# Team Sharing (AdaptableFunction)

The Team Sharing([AdaptableFunctionName](https://api.adaptabletools.com/modules/_src_predefinedconfig_common_types_.html#adaptablefunctionname): `TeamSharing`) Function faciliates the creation of scheduled reminders so that users don't forget to do important grid actions

The Team Sharing function allows users easily to share items they have created with other team members who will have instant access to them.

This saves time, removes the need for duplicated work, and gives your team consistent views of their data.

For example, if a trader is shadowing another trader, they will both need to have the same view of the grid; instead of both traders setting up their grids individually, one trader can set up a search and then share it with the other trader.

Note
Sharing with other team members is a one-click process. Simply click on an item's Share button and it becomes immediately available to everyone else who shares your team storage location. 

These users can then download the item by locating it in the Team Sharing popup and clicking the download button.
