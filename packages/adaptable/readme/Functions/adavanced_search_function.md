# Advanced Search (AdaptableFunction)

Advanced Search ( [AdaptableFunctionName](https://api.adaptabletools.com/modules/_src_predefinedconfig_common_types_.html#adaptablefunctionname): AdvancedSearch) enables you to build complex searches using [*Expressions*](https://api.adaptabletools.com/modules/_src_predefinedconfig_common_expression_.html) (aka Queries)

These searches can include a very wide variety of *Search Criteria* and run across multiple columns.

Advanced Searches are named and saved and, therefore, available for re-use.
