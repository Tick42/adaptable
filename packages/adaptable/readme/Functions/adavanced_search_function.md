# Advanced Search (AdaptableFunction)

Advanced Search enables you to build searches using *Queries* that can be run across multiple columns using a wide variety of *Search Criteria*.

These searched are named and saved and, therefore, available for re-use.

Advanced Search uses an [Expression](https://api.adaptabletools.com/modules/_predefinedconfig_common_expression_.html) (aka Queries) for evaluation.
