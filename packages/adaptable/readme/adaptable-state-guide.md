# AdapTable State Guide

Managing User State is perhaps the most important and valued set of functionality that AdapTable provides.

Conceptually Adaptable State comprises 2 distinct elements (which this doc will discuss in turn):

- **Predefined Config** - State created at **design-time** and given to AdapTable so that at first-time use of the application, the user has everything he or she needs to get started.

- **State Management** - Ensuring that all changes made by the user at **run-time** are saved and persisted to an appropriate location so they are available the next time the system runs.
