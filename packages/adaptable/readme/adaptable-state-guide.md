# AdapTable State Guide

A theme is essentially a collection of css variables that AdapTable exposes, and you can customise. 

You can have more css theme files imported in the app without them overriding each-other.

### System Themes

AdapTable ships with 2 themes: *light* (the default) and *dark*
