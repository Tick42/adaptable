# AdapTable Run-Time Access Guide

Most of the work required by developers in regard to AdapTable is, obviously, done at Design-Time.

This list typically includes downloading and installing AdapTable, integrating it into your code, setting up AdapTableOptions and writing any Predefined Config you want so your instance is 'pre-loaded' with the correct objecs.

However there are a number of ways that developers can access and leverage AdapTable for the benefit of users.  These include:

- the Adaptable Api: the primary way to access an AdapTable instance
- Adaptable Events: subscribe to some of the Events published by AdapTable 
- Notificatins and Alerts: tell your users when something has happened they need to know
- System Status: update users on the overall state of the application

## Help

Developers can learn how to access AdapTable programmatically at [AdapTable Developer Documentation](https://api.adaptabletools.com) 

The other source for Help is our collection of 'Read Me' Docs ([full list here](https://github.com/AdaptableTools/adaptable/blob/master/packages/adaptable/readme/readme-list.md)).

> Previously the main source of AdapTable Help was our [Zendesk Pages](https://adaptabletools.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) but these have been replaced by these 'Read Me' docs and the Developer Documentation that is automatically produced and therefore always up to date.
