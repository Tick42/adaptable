# AdapTable Functions Guide

AdapTable ships with a number of different Functions (currently about 40) - each of which performs a different discrete action of set of functionality.

Most End-User action will be via Functions - either performing an Action (e.g. Quick Search, Smart Edit, Shortcut) or creating / editing an AdaptableObject for use in Function (e.g. Advanced Search, Layout, ConditionalStyle etc.)

## Functions List

AdapTable ships with 2 themes: *light* (the default) and *dark*

If you wish to use the Dark Theme, specify *dark* as the Current Theme in the Theme section of Predefined Config. Make sure, if using ag-Grid, that you also import the associated vendor theme.

You do not need to provide a VendorGridClassName when using either of the System Themes as this is done for you.

This means that you only need provide themes for AdapTable and / or the Vendor Grid if you are unhappy with the defaults that we provide.

We list here each Function alphabetically.
