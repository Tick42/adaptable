# AdapTable Functions Guide

AdapTable ships with many **Functions** (currently about 40) - each of which relates to a discrete 'action' or set of functionality.

Most End-User action in AdapTable will be via Functions.  

Some Functions will perform an action (e.g. Quick Search, Smart Edit).

Other Functions will

All Functions are subject to Entitlements, meaning that end-users will only be able to access them according to their permissions.

Many Functions contain an array of Objects that users can create, edit or delete (if their Entitlements allow).  

### Functions UI

There are a number of different ways in which end-Users will interact with Functions in the AdapTable UI:

- Most Functions have a dedicated 'popup' screen.  Functions that contain an array of items (e.g. AdvancedSearch) will typically show these in a table in the popup with buttons to add / edit.  Functions which perform actions (e.g SmartEdit, BulkUpdate) will enable this.

- Some Functions provide 'Toolbars' which can be displayed in the Dashboard (via Tabs).  These provide easy access to commonly used Functions e.g. Layouts, Reports, Quick Search.  You are able to stipulate which Toolbars are visible through the Dashboard Function.

- are typically managed via 'Wizards' in the AdapTable UI.

These objects can usually be pre-populated via Predefined Config, and the section will the same as the Function Name (e.g. AdvancedSearch, ConditionalStyle etc.)
